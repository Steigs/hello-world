        <p>Being mindful is about awareness. As hitters, we need to be conscious of our body throughout the swing, a task that is much easier said than done. I believe that the most crucial aspects of hitting are the load and timing, as the load constitutes the initial movement of our swing and timing dictates whether our body has a chance to do what it is trained to do or not. If these two pieces aren’t consistent, mechanics tend to break down.<br><br>

            In group seminars and hitting sessions, the goal is to provide athletes with a concrete understanding of timing and what a strong load feels like for each individual hitter. Once hitters comprehend the significance of timing and how it establishes the foundation of the swing, athletes can better grasp why their swing succeeds or breaks down. Often, hitters are simply informed that they are late, or face other surface level issues in their swings without a true understanding or feel for the reasons behind these problems. Once they grasp how to properly evaluate their timing, athletes can more easily adjust their own swings, developing a better feel for their bodies.<br><br>
            
            I frequently pose questions to hitters to help them understand the feel of their swing. If hitters are consistently given instructions without understanding, they will never fully take ownership of their swing, fostering dependency on others. The goal is to help athletes develop their own thoughts and feelings about their swings, enabling quicker adjustments during games. ​Most all hitters are late to some extent, which is why the game of baseball is so hard. Yet the idea of timing is sort of thrown around as if no one really has a distinct answer of how to be on time consistently. In the big leagues, successful hitters know how to synchronize with the pitcher, seeking specific points to match up. This is the focus of our discussions and hitting sessions.<br><br>
            
            These concepts are applicable to any mechanics that hitters are currently working on, as the intention is not to change a player’s swing but to assist them in achieving consistent timing and to increase swing efficiency. With improved timing comes heightened awareness, leading to greater success.</p>
