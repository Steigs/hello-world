        <h1>Mindful Hitting</h1>
        <h4>Become your best coach, by bringing more awareness to your swing</h4>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <p>Being mindful is about awareness. As hitters, we need to be conscious of our body throughout the swing, a task that is much easier said than done. I believe that the most crucial aspects of hitting are the load and timing, as the load constitutes the initial movement of our swing and timing dictates whether our body has a chance to do what it is trained to do or not. If these two pieces aren't consistent, mechanics tend to break down.</p>
        <p>In group seminars and hitting sessions, the goal is to provide athletes with a concrete understanding of timing and what a strong load feels like for each individual hitter. Once hitters comprehend the significance of timing and how it establishes the foundation of the swing, athletes can better grasp why their swing succeeds or breaks down. Often, hitters are simply informed that they are late, or face other surface level issues in their swings without a true understanding or feel for the reasons behind these problems. Once they grasp how to properly evaluate their timing, athletes can more easily adjust their own swings, developing a better feel for their bodies.</p>
        <p>I frequently pose questions to hitters to help them understand the feel of their swing. If hitters are consistently given instructions without understanding, they will never fully take ownership of their swing, fostering dependency on others. The goal is to help athletes develop their own thoughts and feelings about their swings, enabling quicker adjustments during games. â€‹Most all hitters are late to some extent, which is why the game of baseball is so hard. Yet the idea of timing is sort of thrown around as if no one really has a distinct answer of how to be on time consistently. In the big leagues, successful hitters know how to synchronize with the pitcher, seeking specific points to match up. This is the focus of our discussions and hitting sessions.</p>
        <p>These concepts are applicable to any mechanics that hitters are currently working on, as the intention is not to change a player's swing but to assist them in achieving consistent timing and to increase swing efficiency. With improved timing comes heightened awareness, leading to greater success.</p>

            <p><h3><i>The Way of Baseball: Finding Stillness at 95mph</i> - by Shawn Green</h3>

            This book is a fascinating read for any player aspiring to succeed at the next level. Shawn Green shares his journey through the ups and downs of Major League Baseball, 
            including doubts, hard work, friendships, setbacks, and successes. He delves into the mental side of the game, explaining how he transformed hitting into a form of meditation. 
            By finding stillness amidst the chaos, he learned to truly connect with his swing and block out negative thoughts. This exploration of mindfulness and focus is invaluable for athletes 
            looking to enhance their performance.</br>

            <h3><i>The Art of Learning</i> - by Josh Waitzkin</h3>

            In 'The Art of Learning,' Josh Waitzkin shares his journey from becoming the youngest Grandmaster in chess to winning a world championship in Tai Chi. This book transformed my perspective 
            on failure, illustrating how Waitzkin turned every mistake and loss into a valuable learning experience. As athletes, especially hitters, the ability to learn and adjust quickly without being 
            overwhelmed by failure is crucial. Waitzkin's insights helped me reframe failure as an opportunity for growth, When you take this approach, your mental game takes a giant leap forward. </p>

            <h3><i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> - by Timothy Gallwey</h3>

            This book explores the mental game of tennis, focusing on the concept of two selves. Self 1 is the ego, constantly comparing you to others and criticizing your performance, while Self 2 is the 
            instinctive self that simply acts. If Self 2 were always in charge, achieving a state of 'being in the Zone' would come naturally. Athletes often find these two selves in conflict, with Self 1 
            dominating and creating doubt and overthinking. Tim Gallwey guides athletes across all sports on how to quiet Self 1, allowing their natural athleticism to flourish free from comparisons and mental 
            barriers. This is a must-read for any athlete who struggles with letting their mind interfere with their performance.</br>
            
            <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>  
            <h3><i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> - Bhante Gunaratana</h3>
            
            It may seem unusual to include a book about meditation here without direct references to sports, but as athletes progress to higher levels, their thoughts can become more complex and chaotic, and 
            the pressures they face in both sport and life increase. Meditation offers a way to clear those thoughts and find stillness, which can be beneficial not only in life but also on the field. Being 
            able to return to your breath and stay present during high-pressure moments can give you an edge over players who are nervous and overwhelmed. I know I played with a lot of fear growing up, and 
            meditation would have helped in those situations. This is one of the best and simplest books on meditation I have read, providing a great starting point for anyone interested in taking that first step.</br>

            <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>  
            <h3><i>The Mindful Athlete</i> - by George Mumford</h3>
            
            "George Mumford worked with championship NBA teams, including the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, as well as legendary athletes like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. His role was to help 
            players enhance their mental game at the highest level of sports. Mumford taught them about meditation and the importance of maintaining a clear mind, as a clouded mindset can lead to poor 
            performance. When athletes are fully present and enjoying the process of competition, they can achieve a state of flow, often referred to as being 'in the zone.' This state allows for incredible 
            displays of athleticism and performance. Overall, the book emphasizes how mindfulness can transform not only athletic performance but also the athletes' approach to their sport and life.</br>
            <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>            
            <h3><i>Relentless: From Good to Great to Unstoppable</i> - by Tim Grover</h3>
            
            This book serves as a gut check for any athlete seeking to understand the work ethic of the top one percent. Tim Grover, who trained legends like Michael Jordan and Dwyane Wade, shares his 
            experiences working with the best athletes in the world and what truly separates them from the rest. Grover introduces concepts like 'cleaners,' 'closers,' and 'beginners' to illustrate different 
            levels of commitment and performance. Just when you think you're working hard, this book puts things into perspective, showing what it really means to give your all in your sport. If you're willing 
            to embrace the challenge, you'll gain a deeper understanding of relentless dedication and what it takes to reach the highest levels of achievement.</br></p>
