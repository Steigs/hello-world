Be on Time 
What every hitter needs to know about timing

Intro

Why This Book?
This book is a culmination of concepts, ideas, and experiences from my playing and coaching careers up to this point. I have always been fascinated with hitting a baseball. When I probably should have been taking more ground balls, I found myself in the cage. Hitting was what I wanted to be good at and I wanted to know how to make my swing the best it could be. To this day I still take swings in my kitchen when I am making food. The ability to hit at a high level is an art and helping athletes figure out there own swing and assisting them in putting the pieces together is one of the most enjoyable things I get to do.
A little bit about my playing career. I attended South Kitsap High School in Port Orchard Washington and went on to play at Washington State University. I ended up quitting my sophomore year and stayed on to become the equipment manager in order to stick around our hitting coach at the time. While I was burnt out at the time, I always enjoyed learning more about the swing. My Junior year I started over at Sierra College, a Juco in Rocklin, California. From there I played a year at Lewis Clark State where I was fortunate enough to sign as a free agent pick with the New York Yankees. I had the opportunity to learn from players and coaches who have excelled in the sport and understood the swing at the highest level. These coaches were able to distill complex ideas about big league hitters and convey them to me and other athletes in simple, understandable terms. My thoughts and ideas have been shaped by the many amazing coaches I have had the privilege to work alongside, starting with my dad at a young age and continuing with high-level coaches who have played and now coach at the highest level.
Having coached younger athletes ranging from 10 years old to the collegiate level, I have built upon the concepts I was taught and have observed what works and what doesn’t. I am not here to reinvent the wheel; rather, I aim to provide you with a different perspective on your swing that may help you make it more efficient and easier to understand.
There will always be differing opinions on the swing and various approaches to the challenging task of hitting a baseball. What I have discovered is that timing is one of the few aspects of the swing that very few people truly understand, yet it is arguably the most important element of hitting. The good news is that a significant majority of big league hitters reach the same position at the same time in relation to the pitch, which means we can achieve that too.
Over the past decade, I have worked with younger hitters, and I have found that timing is the single most difficult aspect for them to grasp. This difficulty arises from several main factors: first, timing is the one variable that changes from day to day and even pitch to pitch. Second, this game is incredibly fast and hitting a baseball is incredibly difficult. All hitters are late at one point or another, even the big league hitters, who are the best in the world at being on time. Third, there are not many people who can effectively explain timing and fewer who can explain in detail what they expect from the hitters they work with. This is not to say that they cannot teach hitting; it simply means that timing has often been an elusive aspect of the swing, with coaches telling hitters they need to be “earlier” or that they are “late,” without providing any context for what that actually means or where they need to be in their swing at a specific moment. I have been that coach too, so this is not a criticism of anyone. My hope is that the stories from my own experiences and the techniques outlined in this book will help clarify the timing issue and enhance your overall understanding of your swing.
While this book is intended for hitters of all ages and skill levels, I will assume that you have a solid understanding of your swing. Concepts such as load, extension, connection, and staying inside the baseball are examples of what I expect you to already know or have a decent grasp of. While consistent timing will benefit everyone, athletes with a better understanding of their swing will find it easier to grasp some of the more complex ideas presented in this book.
The concepts that will be discussed can be integrated with any style or mechanical work that hitters practice. This will not be a book filled with extensive mechanics, but rather one that complements mechanical work to create greater efficiency and consistency at the plate. It is crucial to understand the complexities of your mechanics as a hitter, but the challenge lies in distilling that complexity into simple thoughts. Too much thinking can slow us down and lead to an indecisive swing. Successful hitters work on their mechanics daily so that when game time arrives, they can simplify all that effort into one or two thoughts, allowing them to trust their training and execute with efficiency. There are no doubts or extra thoughts to hinder them. Learning how to consistently be on time enables our thoughts to remain simple and allows our swing to function as we have trained it.
There is an overwhelming amount of information available about hitting a baseball. With the advent of new technology, we have countless ways to analyze the swing, which has produced some of the most impressive hitters in the sport but also created confusion about what is best and what hitters should focus on. To be clear, there are many successful styles, and every athlete thinks, feels, and focuses on something slightly different that helps them individually. Different perspectives on mechanics will always exist, and people will continually seek the latest trends. However, there is one absolute in hitting that all big league hitters share, yet it is rarely discussed in detail: being on time.
Timing is the most critical aspect of hitting a baseball, and very few people are teaching how to achieve it or how significantly it affects the rest of the swing. While there is no silver bullet that will solve all problems—hitting a baseball will never be a perfect art—consistently being on time gives hitters the best chance to succeed and allows the body to function most efficiently.

Chapter 1: Don’t Be Late

Throughout my career, particularly between the ages of 12 and 20, including my time in college, I was frequently advised to get my foot down earlier. Coaches would often yell across the field, “You’re late, start earlier!” While this advice was technically correct, my frustration stemmed from not understanding how to start earlier and still make solid contact. Two scenarios typically occurred: I would either get my foot down early as instructed, but then feel stuck because my momentum would stop, often resulting in me being late anyway as I had to essentially restart my swing, or I would tense up my shoulders and hands in an attempt to generate power from a dead stop. Alternatively, I might start my load earlier to get my foot down, but then I would drift through the swing, ending up on my front foot or lunging because I wasn’t accustomed to initiating my load that early. In either case, I found myself in a weak position. After struggling to hit consistently with this “get your foot down earlier” approach, I would abandon it and revert to what felt comfortable, trying to prove the coaches wrong. I resented the idea of “getting my foot down early,” even though it was valid, because I never truly understood what it meant. No one ever explained how to effectively start earlier while maintaining a fluid swing without stopping or tensing up. Does this sound familiar? It wasn’t until I was trying to hit 96 mph in professional baseball that a coach finally pulled me aside and explained how to load correctly, why we load early, and how to navigate the rest of the swing without feeling stuck on my back side, halting my momentum, or lunging toward my front side.
How many times have you heard “Don’t be late!” in your career? This phrase has become a common refrain among coaches, yet very few truly explore the nuances of timing—what it looks like, what it feels like, and the actual difference between being late and being on time. While it can be relatively easy to identify when a hitter is late, there are not many coaches teaching players how to consistency be on time, and even fewer who instruct hitters on how to create more time.
Before we delve into the details, let’s clarify what being late actually means. As a hitter, how do you know if you are late? The most common indicators include feeling rushed, swinging underneath the pitch, fouling a ball off sideways, chopping a ball off the plate, or even check swinging. While these are all valid signs, there are many other situations that can indicate late timing that may not be immediately obvious. For instance, we’ve discussed the “get your foot down” comment, but you may have also heard, “You’re pulling your head/shoulder.” These are also signs that you are late, which I will explain in further detail. What about lunging or swinging at poor pitches? How about rolling over or feeling tension in your hands and shoulders after they have taken over your swing? All of these instances can result from being late with our timing. I know some of these may sound counterintuitive and seem more likely to be labeled as early, but I will clarify.
The easiest way to determine if we are late as hitters is to take a video and check where contact was made (if contact was made at all). If contact occurs behind the front knee, we are obviously late. The front knee is about as far back in the stance as we would ever hit a ball. There are some exceptions, but we should strive to hit the ball out in front, meaning our contact point should ideally be made anywhere from the front foot to about 18 inches in front of it. This may seem a bit drastic, but this accounts for big league hitters too. The distance will vary based on the size and proportions of the hitter. On the flip side though, no matter the size of the hitter, as soon as the ball passes the front knee, the body must react in a way that we did not train for in order to get the barrel to the baseball. This can include rushing, flying open (which usually leads to pulling the head) to create space for the barrel, or rolling over as the body backs up on the pitch, causing the wrists to roll early to compensate for lost time.
Now, let’s discuss the instances I mentioned earlier.
Feeling Rushed: When we start our load late as hitters and the ball is coming out of the pitcher’s hand while we are still going back, our body has to rush forward to catch up (we will discuss the correct timing of the load in a later chapter). The ball is moving toward the plate while our body—and more importantly, our eyes—are still moving backward, leading to a rush forward in order to catch up. This causes several issues: the pitch appears faster than it is because our eyes are moving in two different directions while the ball is in flight, and the body knows it doesn’t have enough time to catch up, prompting it to take shortcuts that break down mechanics. Now that we are out of sync and unable to see the pitch well, the chances of making solid contact are diminished, and we become susceptible to off-speed pitches or even pitches outside the strike zone because we never had a good look at the pitch.
Flying Open/Pulling the Head: For many young athletes, this is the most significant issue in their swing. It is so noticeable that coaches often call it out across the field for everyone to hear. When athletes hear this comment, I often ask them, “Do you ever practice pulling your head or shoulder?” The answer is invariably no. So why does it happen?
This issue stems from being late and rushed. As the pitch approaches the plate, the body quickly recognizes that the hitter is late, often faster than we can consciously comprehend. In an attempt to catch up, the body tries to take shortcuts in different ways, causing the hands and shoulders to take over in order to get the barrel to the baseball. The hands instinctively know they need to speed up to have a chance. This can be demonstrated with tee work. Place the tee in line with your stride foot (post-stride) or even a few inches in front of it. Now, in slow motion, try to get your barrel square to the baseball. This should be relatively easy, as you have the space to execute what your body has been trained to do.
Now, place the tee in line with your front hip (again, post-stride) or even further back in your stance and attempt the same slow-motion swing. You will find this much more difficult without pulling your shoulder or awkwardly drawing your hands in, ultimately resulting in a weak feeling at contact. Now, imagine this scenario with a pitch coming at you. Your body will rush to create space for the barrel, which usually leads to a pulled shoulder or head, resulting in a rollover, flare, or weak contact, if contact is made at all. There is also an instance of just trying to do too much or getting too big on a pitch, where the hitter fly’s open because they over swing. However, I believe that more often than not, that late timing is the culprit to the shoulder and head being pulled off the baseball. As we will see later in the book, you can swing pretty hard and still stay on the baseball if you are on time and the swing is initiated from the correct part of the body.
Check Swings: Not all check swings are bad, but have you ever noticed how a hitter who is consistently on time and relaxed takes a pitch? It’s as if they can tell the pitch is a ball as it leaves the pitcher's hand. The take is effortless, almost as if they were never going to swing. Yet, on the next pitch that is left over the plate, they smash a double into the gap.
On the flip side, hitters who are late and rushed tend to aggressively check swing to the point that they may even make contact, resulting in an easy out. These are the takes where the hands come forward instead of the backside starting and then checking off the pitch. Everything looks tight and tense. Typically, this is a hitter who is not seeing the ball well and is hitting with an elevated heart rate because they are either uncomfortable or trying to do too much.
Now, I am not against an aggressive take; look how good Juan Soto’s takes are. However, I believe there is a big difference between an aggressive take when we are on time, with the lower half engaged and ready to fire, and the tight upper half that struggles to hold off on the swing. You will notice that as aggressive as Soto’s takes look, he rarely check swings; it is always his backside firing and then checking off the pitch. This all goes back to how early and how much control the hitter has. If the hitter is late, the body tries to catch up, and without recognizing the pitch well, the hands start to take over and commit, and then at the last second, they try to hold off. Hitters who are early, calm, and have backside control tend to see the ball much better, making the take much easier without second-guessing.
Another place this is really noticeable is when a player gets hit by a pitch or is brushed back. A hitter who is loose and on time tends to roll away from the brush-back pitches or is able to protect themselves better when they do get hit. Hitters who are rushing can check swing into a pitch that hits them on the wrist, which is always unfortunate to see. Of course, these are general statements, as some pitchers have very good stuff and can fool even the best hitters. However, in general, if you start to pay attention to your takes, you will learn a lot about your timing.
Swinging Underneath: Most hitters understand that swinging underneath a pitch is a result of being late. This is most easily recognizable with a high fastball, as it becomes increasingly difficult to make solid contact. If hitters are just slightly late, they often swing and miss underneath or pop the ball up. This principle holds true for any pitch on which we are late. Consider what we discussed regarding pulling the head or shoulder and how this relates to this situation. When we are late and the body must clear space, the shoulder flies open, which tends to drop the barrel behind us. This also occurs when we lack the time to catch the baseball out front. Hitters may become stuck on their backside in an attempt to catch up, causing the barrel to drop behind them and resulting in a miss underneath the pitch.
What many hitters do not realize is that even on pitches we foul straight back—typically you will hear the comment, “He just missed that one!” from someone commenting or watching the game—this is also caused by being just a tick late. The barrel must drop into the zone, and the further out front the barrel gets, the more uphill it works, usually matching the plane of the pitch for hitters with a good swing. This is ideal, but it only happens when the barrel releases out front with good timing. When the barrel drops into the zone and the pitch gets too deep into the plate, we miss the pitch underneath and foul it straight back. The comment “just missed it,” is correct as this reflects a tiny fraction of a second late, but few discuss that the hitter is actually late; they simply chalk it up to just missing. Now that we understand the true cause is late timing, we can better adjust based on the feedback from the foul ball. If we adjust to the next pitch by trying to be a little earlier and catch it a few inches further out front (which is difficult to quantify due to the short amount of time), we will have a higher likelihood of squaring up that same pitch. Of course, nothing is guaranteed, and the next pitch will likely be different, but we will be better prepared as we start the load earlier, giving ourselves more time to see and react to the pitch. This game is all about adjustments from pitch to pitch, so being aware of these subtle timing adjustments can significantly impact our statistics over the long run. However, viewing it as “oh, I just missed” does not allow us to make any meaningful adjustments moving forward.
Rolling Over: This is one of my favorite topics to discuss, as it is often counter intuitive. When I ask hitters why they roll over, the majority will say it is because they are too early. While this can be true, especially on an off-speed pitch, they often overlook the cause of many of their rollovers. Recall the reason we pull our head or shoulder: when the ball gets too deep on us (due to late timing), the body must compensate and pull off or clear space for the barrel. This action creates the rollover, or the up-and-across angle of the barrel that produces the rollover. Another instance occurs when a hitter gets stuck on their backside, typically due to being late, causing the hands to be pulled across the body because they cannot release their backside, which results in a rollover.
We can demonstrate this with a tee drill. Place a tee on the inside corner directly in line with your stride foot (post-stride). This position will feel uncomfortable as you approach the tee. However, this drill is excellent for working on staying inside the ball, achieving extension, and gaining a better understanding of your body’s positioning. If you can hit this ball up the middle, it indicates that many aspects of your swing are functioning correctly.
However, during the first attempt at this drill, players often feel so uncomfortable with the ball positioned this deep that their bodies instinctively try to take over with the hands which causes them to come across the baseball from the tension they created in their upper half or they try to clear space, either by leaning back on the back leg or pulling the shoulder early. Consequently, the first few swings often result in rollovers as players adjust to the drill. This exercise clearly demonstrates that you don’t have to be early to roll over; the depth of the tee represents late timing (an inside pitch should ideally be hit well out in front of the stride foot to generate power and carry to the pull side).
Weak Contact/Chopping the Ball Off the Plate As we have discussed, most of our mechanical issues stem from being late with our timing, which causes the body to react in ways we have not trained it to. Understanding this concept makes it easier to see that awkward swings, along with a significant amount of bad contact—from flares to jam shots to rollovers—are primarily caused by late timing. While being too early to the front foot can also cause issues, most hitters can immediately recognize when they are too early. In contrast, many hitters struggle to identify when they are late because, unless they are drastically late, it can be challenging to diagnose.
The ball takes approximately four-tenths of a second to travel from the pitcher’s hand to the glove, which we can approximate as fifty-five feet for the sake of argument. This means a fastball takes about seventy-three thousandths of a second to travel one foot (0.4 / 55). We are discussing allowing a ball to get a couple of inches too deep. For the ball to travel a couple of inches deeper into the zone takes just a fraction of that time. This is why consistently being on time is so difficult and why diagnosing it is even harder. It is much easier to observe the result of the swing and say, “You pulled your shoulder,” than it is to recognize that you let the ball travel about eight inches too deep. Our brains do not function this way.
This isn’t to say you need to think about this type of math while hitting a baseball. Instead, we need to give ourselves the most time possible to see the pitch and allow our barrel to stay in the zone for as long as we can. We are playing probabilities here; the longer we can see the pitch and stay in the zone, the better our chances of making good contact. We will discuss this concept in greater detail in later chapters.
Late to Be Early - Lunging and Poor Pitch Selection: This is another counter intuitive situation worth discussing. How can lunging and swinging at off-speed pitches in the dirt be related to being late? In other words, how can I be late and still be early to contact?
The answer again relates to feeling rushed. If we start our load too late and the body rushes forward to catch up, it often resorts to catching up to the fastest pitch—the fastball. As a result, we speed up our movements to get our body moving forward. With our eyes rushing forward and tension building in our bodies, we anticipate a fastball, only to realize too late that it is an off-speed pitch or one in the dirt. This leads us to lunge and flail at the ball, as we never gave ourselves the chance to recognize the pitch. In essence, we were “early” because we started so late that we had to rush and ultimately got fooled.
Tension: We touched on this concept earlier, but tension in the swing is something I highly recommend becoming more aware of. I encountered this idea in the books “The Inner Game of Tennis” and “The Inner game of Golf” by Tim Gallwey, and I believe it applies to hitting a baseball just as much as it does to hitting a tennis ball and golf ball.
There is both good tension and bad tension, as is the case in any sport. We need to create tension to generate more power, but we also need to transfer and release that tension to fully utilize that power. We will explore where to create tension and how to transfer and release it later on, but for now, it is essential to understand that being late creates tension in areas where we do not want it.
The next time you are hitting in a cage, pay attention to where you feel tension in your body. You will likely notice that when you make solid contact with the ball, there is minimal tension throughout your body, or perhaps just some tension in your back leg or hip, which is a positive sign. Conversely, when you hit balls with topspin, when you rollover, or hit a little flare, you will probably feel tension in your shoulders, wrists, or upper body in general. This is the type of tension we want to avoid, as it leads to a slow, tight swings that come across the body, resulting in weaker contact with little to no carry on the ball.
So, how does timing affect tension? As we have mentioned, when we are late and have to rush or catch the ball too deep, the upper body tends to take shortcuts to reach the baseball or tries to catch up. In doing so, the upper body, wrists, and shoulders tense up. This is why being aware of this feeling is crucial. If you recognize your tension, you can learn from it, just as you do by observing ball flight after contact. If you notice top spinning ball flight and feel tension in your shoulders, the first question you should ask yourself is, “Was I on time for that pitch?” Most likely, the answer is no; you were a bit late. By starting your swing earlier and catching the ball more out front, you create space and freedom, reducing tension. This allows your swing to function as it was trained to, resulting in a more fluid and powerful motion. We will get into the load and using your back side to create a more fluid swing as well. Between being on time and using your legs, the tension in your upper half will get easier to release.
It is important to note that these issues can arise from factors other than timing in certain situations. The goal is not to fix every poorly hit baseball or every missed swing, as that is unrealistic. Hitting a baseball is an extremely challenging skill. Instead, the aim is to provide a different perspective and to analyze your swing from the earliest possible point—when you begin your motion. If you find yourself struggling or missing several balls in a row during practice, the first question to consider is whether you are on time. Can you initiate your swing a little earlier and with a calmer tempo and mindset, allowing your swing to perform as you have trained it to?
If you are anything like me, after going 0-for-4 or having a rough day in the cage, your immediate thought may be, “My swing is broken; I need to change my mechanics.” However, altering your swing every time you have a bad day is a difficult task and often leads to confusion and prolonged slumps due to the numerous variables that change each day. Most of the time, when we address our timing, our swing naturally falls back into place. Focus on timing first: get loaded earlier and give yourself more time to see the baseball. If this approach does not yield improvement, you can then begin to make mechanical adjustments. With this perspective, understanding and “fixing” your swing should become easier, as you will have more awareness of your body, and the panic of flawed mechanics is not the first response.
To be clear, there is no silver bullet or cheat code to hitting. It is a challenging skill, and there will always be mechanics and thought processes that work for a time, only to fall apart and then work again. Hitters can have near perfect swings and yet still struggle with results. While there is no single solution that addresses every swing issue, consistently being on time is one of the most critical keys to hitting and provides the best chance for success.

Chapter 2: Timing Checkpoints: How to Be On Time
Now that we understand what it feels like to be late, let's explore what being on time truly looks like.
There are four checkpoints I consider when evaluating timing, and every big league hitter is aware of them, even if we are typically unaware of their significance. I didn’t learn about these checkpoints until I played professional baseball, and I didn’t fully grasp their importance until after my playing career.
Here are a few questions I love to ask hitters regarding these checkpoints:
    • When do big league hitters start their load? 
    • Where is the baseball when big league hitters reach the top of their load (the moment when the negative movement stops and they are ready to stride forward into the ball, e.g., the top of the leg kick)? 
    • Where is the ball when big league hitters get their front foot down? 
    • Where do big league hitters make contact in relation to the depth of the pitch, especially on home runs and doubles? (If you could see a hitter from the side, do they make contact with the pitch when it is in the center of their body, at their back foot, at their front knee, at their front foot, or out in front of their front foot?) 
Do you know the answers to these questions?
If not, don’t worry; you are not alone. As I mentioned, I didn’t know the answers either when I was playing. This is why people often respond with “be earlier” or “get your foot down.” While they can tell when a hitter is late, they don’t really know where the hitter should be at different points in the swing. If hitters don’t know the answers to these questions, it is impossible for them to consistently be on time. Similarly, if coaches don’t know the answers, they cannot teach consistent timing.
The questions I asked relate to the four timing checkpoints that I believe are key to understanding good timing.
Here are the four checkpoints and the answers to the questions above:
Hitter:
    1. Start of the Load 
    2. Top of the Load 
    3. Foot Strike 
    4. Contact 
Pitcher and Ball:
    1. Hand Separation 
    2. Release Point (the ball is just about to leave the hand) 
    3. The ball is halfway to the plate 
    4. In line with the front knee or further out in front. Doubles and home runs are typically hit when the ball is at the front foot or beyond. 
Let’s take a closer look at each of these checkpoints.
Start of the Load
A hitter's load should begin no later than when the pitcher separates their hands. While this can happen earlier, this is a great reference point for several reasons. Although all pitchers have different styles—quick pitch, sidearm, submarine, over the top, three-quarters—they all must separate their hands and make some type of circular motion with their arm. This motion occurs not only in games but also in batting practice and front toss, where there is a break in the hands and a back-and-forth swing in the arm. Therefore, we always have a consistent starting point to consider. If a hitter can start their load no later than hand separation, they are giving themselves a great chance of being in the right position for the following checkpoints.
Top of the Load
The top of the load refers to the moment when the negative motion is complete, and the hitter is ready to move forward. This feeling involves getting into the back side, where the hitter could balance if they lifted their front foot. There should be a sensation of settling into the back hip, where the hitter feels strongest and is prepared to move forward at any moment. This feeling should coincide with the ball reaching the pitcher’s release point. As the ball starts to come forward (releasing from the hand), the hitter needs to begin their forward motion. We will discuss the load in more detail in a later chapter.
Foot Strike
This checkpoint often surprises hitters. If we load on time and initiate our forward motion at release, our stride foot will naturally touch down when the ball is anywhere from halfway to two-thirds of the way to the plate. There is a window here due to the varying velocities of pitchers. This is not something we should be consciously thinking about during our swing, but it can be helpful when reviewing video of an at-bat. You may be on time with your load and at release, but you can still be late getting your foot down if you linger at the top of your load too long. By reviewing this checkpoint with video or having a coach or teammate observe an at-bat from the dugout, you can gain a better understanding of where your timing may be breaking down.
Contact
The final checkpoint is contact. This one is obvious and is often the first thing people focus on regarding timing, as it is the most visible aspect. If a ball is hit straight sideways, it is easy to tell that the hitter is late. If contact is not made between the front knee and about 18 inches in front of the stride foot, then the timing is likely off. When hitters are on time, making contact feels effortless, and the ball flight is typically more ideal, resulting in better backspin and carry.
Combining All Four Checkpoints
These checkpoints are invaluable for identifying where timing may break down. However, there is really only one aspect we can consciously control: our load. If we start our load on time, the other checkpoints tend to fall into place. This is not guaranteed, as we can linger too long in our load or speed up our tempo, among other issues. But if our load is executed on time, we give ourselves the best possible chance for the other checkpoints to occur at the right moments.
This means that if you feel a checkpoint is off, such as timing, the initial question shouldn’t be mechanical—like whether you pulled your head—but rather whether you were on time or if you started your load early enough. From there, we can make more informed adjustments.
By understanding and applying these four timing checkpoints, hitters can improve their consistency and performance at the plate. Recognizing the importance of timing in relation to the pitch can lead to better swings, more solid contact, and ultimately, greater success in the game.
Chapter 3: Benefits of Being on Time

There are many benefits to being on time, beyond just more consistent contact. While achieving damage at the plate more consistently is the goal, being early and/or on time will enhance other aspects of your swing as well.
First, let’s discuss why contact and power increase when you are consistently on time. When you are on time, the game slows down just a bit. Since we only have four-tenths of a second to react, any small amount of extra time is a significant advantage. This slowing down allows your eyes and your swing more time to react to the pitch.
With more time to react, our swing becomes more efficient, smooth, and powerful, as the shoulders and hands don’t have to tighten up to rush the barrel into the zone. This enables our backside to fully utilize the potential energy stored during the load (plus, the load becomes more powerful as there is more time to reach the position where you feel strongest). When the backside is allowed to release without rushing, the barrel moves faster, and your exit velocity should increase as you make contact out front more naturally. This results in more consistent backspin and harder contact (effortless pop).
Not only does contact increase, but plate discipline also improves. The longer you can see a pitch, the more likely you are to swing at pitches you want and the easier it becomes to lay off pitches out of the zone, even good off-speed pitches that might cause a rushed hitter to chase.
Hitters who are on time can also naturally make better adjustments to off-speed pitches. When we are on time and our backside controls the swing, we can be ready for the fastball while also hanging back and riding our backside longer to account for a slower pitch. Consider Adrian Beltre, who would occasionally go down to a knee to hit a breaking ball. Because he was on time and used his backside to get to the baseball, he could naturally control his tempo and lengthen his stride to create extra time for the slower pitch. He would lengthen his stride and sink further into his legs to hit the off-speed pitch. Most younger hitters rush or control their stride with their front foot, causing them to lunge or come up and out of their swing. In contrast, a hitter who is on time and has control in their backside can ride the back hip (without thinking about it) to create more time for a slower pitch. This demonstrates that we always have a chance to hit when we are early, but hitting becomes exceedingly more difficult when we are late.
Working on being early to on time helps us develop better backside control, which allows us to create more time and see the ball longer, resulting in better contact, more power, improved adjustability, and enhanced plate discipline.
Another significant benefit of good timing, which may be the most important in the long run, is how much simpler it makes our thought process as hitters. Once you have a feel for being on time consistently, you worry less about mechanical issues. Personally, as a young hitter, whenever I went 0 for 4 or had a rough game, my immediate thought was that my mechanics were breaking down and something was wrong with my swing. The next day, I would change something in my swing and base my next performance on that.
While part of this was true—my mechanics were breaking down—the reason was not that mechanics randomly fail or that the new style I chose wasn’t effective. The mechanics broke down because I was late, and as we have discussed, mechanics deteriorate when we begin to rush.
Once I understood that my mechanics were not the initial issue, but rather my timing, all the mechanical concerns I had in the box began to fade away. I just had to focus on getting my load started on time and let the rest of the swing happen. As long as my timing was good, the swing performed as I had trained it to do. Is it perfect? Of course not, but my swing became much freer because there were fewer intrusive and complex thoughts. I was able to focus on hunting the pitch I was looking for and let the swing flow. The freer the swing, the better chance we have of doing damage at the plate.
As experienced hitters know, you can often tell when someone is overthinking at the plate. Their rigidity and indecisiveness are evident. Once you spend enough time working on your load, controlling your backside, and getting on time, it all starts to become a “feeling” that your body recognizes. You can literally see the change in hitters who start a tick late and bounce off their load into a weak position. When they adjust to start things a little earlier and calmer, they settle into their backside sooner, almost as if they are now waiting on the fastball instead of reacting to it. If you are ever in the cage with a hitter who truly understands timing, you can tell by the moment of release whether they are going to hit the ball well or not. Pitchers can see this moment too. When facing a dangerous hitter, pitchers often find it intimidating to see a batter in perfect synchronization with the timing of their arm, knowing that if they miss their spot, the hitter will most likely capitalize on it.
Being on time, or even slightly early, with the load and learning how to control the swing with the backside removes many other variables, whether it be overthinking, mechanical flaws, or rushing. With this understanding, whenever you are struggling or just missing pitches in the cage, the first questions you should ask yourself are, “Was I truly on time for that pitch?” and “Could I have been a little earlier?” Often, even when we feel like we just missed a pitch and believe we were on time, we can still get a bit earlier into the backside to give ourselves an even better chance.
Next, we will discuss how to engage our backside, what it feels like, and why it is so important for the rest of our swing.
Chapter 4 - The Load
In my opinion, the load may be the most important part of the swing. As hitters, if we can get into a strong position on time, we give ourselves the best chance to do damage at the plate, and the load is where it all begins.
So, how do we get the most out of our load? What does it look like, and more importantly, what does it feel like?
The load builds our power, gives us control of our swing, and allows us to make adjustments mid-pitch. A good load is slightly different for every hitter, but generally, a hitter is fully loaded when they have complete control in their back hip. This means that as a hitter goes into their negative movement, they want to reach a point where they feel their weight “catch” in their back hip. For some, this is a coil; for others, it’s a backward movement, as if they are shifting their weight toward the catcher. Some may use a leg kick or a toe tap to achieve a balanced and strong position. The key is to feel as strong as possible in our back hip. A simple way to know if you are there is by loading into your back hip while keeping your front foot on the ground. When you reach a point where you could lift your front foot and balance, you are in a fully loaded position. (This may not be as accurate for hitters with a wider stance, but you should still feel tension in your back hip, glute, and groin to know when you are back far enough.) We want complete control, meaning that when we are fully loaded into our backside, we can determine when to move forward. We shouldn’t be bouncing off our backside, falling, or gliding into our front leg. Instead, we use our back hip to drive into our stride.
A good analogy is to think of a column that supports a structure. This column represents our back leg, while the structure represents our body. To support the weight of the structure and control it so it doesn’t sway or fall, we need to build that column before putting weight onto it. Many hitters tend to rush this process. For example, consider a hitter with a leg kick, who may push or kick themselves into their back hip. They can fall into the trap of rushing to their backside, using their front leg to kick them back, which can lead to going too far or bouncing off their backside due to a lack of control. The column hasn’t been built and cannot support the swaying weight. Instead, before the front foot comes off the ground, the hitter should shift their weight into their back hip. Once a majority of the weight is on the backside—let’s say around 70% (don’t put too much emphasis on percentages, as hitters often focus too much on these numbers; this is just to help you think about weight distribution while both feet are still on the ground)—then they can go into the leg kick, making it more controlled and allowing the weight to stack up on the back hip. This way, they can drive forward into the pitch using their back side, instead of falling forward onto the front side or getting stuck on the back leg and losing all the power they were trying to build.
When it comes to loading the hands, there are a couple of different options. The most important aspect of either method is that your hands need to be in the strongest position to hit by the time your front foot is down.
One method is to create separation, or a hand load, as your body moves forward into the pitch. This can be a bit more challenging to sequence and time correctly, but it can add extra whip and separation to the swing, and some hitters do it very naturally. Think of David Ortiz or Mookie Betts as two good examples. They both load their lower half, with their hands lose and closer to their shoulder, but as they start to drive forward their hands are stretching back to create more torque.
The other method, which I find a bit easier to get into the correct position consistently, involves the hands and body moving back together in the load. The goal is to reach the strongest position in both the hip and the hands by the time the pitcher releases the ball, allowing the back hip to drive the swing while the hands go along for the ride. Think Robinson Cano and Aaron Judge.
In both scenarios, as long as the upper half can essentially “fall asleep” and the back hip leads the swing, the barrel will naturally get on plane and explode through the zone, staying in the zone longer. This is because a loose upper half creates more of a whip-like action with the barrel. While it may seem counter-intuitive to think that in order to hit a ball harder, our upper half needs to be looser, it remains true. Consider this: when you throw a baseball, whether on the mound or in the field, if you grip the ball as hard as you can, how far do you think you will throw it? You’ll probably bury it into the ground twenty feet in front of you. The hand and arm tense up, creating a shortened rotation of the arm. A player who uses their legs to throw and keeps their arm loose and whippy will create much more velocity and throw the ball much farther. It may even be easier to think about what can create more speed: a rigid 2x4 piece of wood (representing a tense upper half) or a whip (representing a loose upper half). While the board is much more rigid, which seems like a better object to swing, it can generate only a fraction of the whip's speed because of that rigidity (a whip moves so fast it can break the sound barrier). Think of your upper half like the whip, while your back hip is what is driving the swing.
If you have ever attended a big league baseball game or watched players take batting practice, you may have noticed that sometimes it sounds like a gunshot when they make contact. This sound cannot be produced by a tense upper half, as the barrel moves too slowly. When hitters attack with their back hip and keep the upper half loose, the barrel accelerates at a much greater rate, resulting in a louder impact. You will notice this phenomenon in any rotational sport, from baseball and softball (both hitting and throwing) to tennis, golf, javelin, throwing a football, or a frisbee, and even hitting a volleyball or kicking a soccer ball. Anything that requires a kinetic chain or energy creation and release will move more efficiently when you understand where and when to build tension and how to release it in motion. Martial arts provide another great example: when throwing a punch, a kick, or dodging, the tighter a person is, the slower these motions happen.
While this may sound easy, nothing could be harder to maintain consistently. The human brain is wired to exert more effort when we fail or when we pain. Think about a sport like football, if you are going to tackle someone and you get stiff armed and the fail to make the tackle, what is the obvious thing to do next play. Try harder and bury that guy next time you face him. In hitting, as soon as we panic because we are late, or we get beat by a pitch, we naturally want to do more, or swing harder to make up for it. This is the opposite of what will create success. We have to learn to be aware of the tension, and aware of the want to do more, take a breath slow it down by getting back earlier, seeing the ball longer and relaxing in the upper half more.
On the flip side, the brain tends to do the same thing once you have successfully executed a movement. Meaning that as you start to get the hang of this and hit the ball hard—perhaps even hitting a home run in batting practice with what felt like very little effort—your brain may say, "Wow, I think I can hit it even further," and it will engage all the muscles in your upper body to try to do so, only to result in rolling over the ball because everything got tight again. It takes a lot of training and discipline to become aware of this tension and to avoid overreacting by creating tension in the wrong areas. This often happens in games versus a controlled environment in the batting cage. I experienced this problem every year in professional baseball when we finally got to take batting practice on the field during Spring Training. After being in the cage all off-season, during the first few days back on the field, my eyes would get too big as I wanted to put on a show. I would get tight and try to muscle balls out, making it difficult to hit even a few out of the infield during my first couple of rounds or even days. All that training and knowledge went out the window because I was trying too hard to impress people. Once the adrenaline kicks in and you are competing against someone, it becomes very challenging not to use “everything you have” to win that battle. This is just human nature. The best hitters in the world know how to breathe, control their heart rate, and trust their training to avoid getting too amped up when facing a good pitcher. They understand that they will be better off using their backside to get to pitches while staying calm, rather than trying to speed up or create more tension. Again, this is much easier said than done.
Something that I have found that seems to help a lot of hitters is the idea of your body having two separate halves. I want to keep hitters swinging hard, we just need the tension to be coming from the right place. As we know, most players who swing hard, spin off the ball, get tight in the shoulders and create a lot of top spin or swing and miss because the barrel is actually moving slower. With the idea of two halves of their body, they can still get the feeling of swinging hard, but with the tension in the correct place. Think of your body in two halves, one is the upper half and one is the lower half. They can both create tension in the load to the point of you settling into your back side, but once you start to move forward, the upper half needs to basically fall asleep or relax as much as it can, while the lower half (or really back side) keeps all the tension and drives it forward into the baseball. The hands will be along for the ride. I have worked with a lot of hitters who either want to swing hard to create more velocity, which is a fair thought, but when I tell them to relax they get the feeling that they are being lazy because they are not using everything. This two halves thought process allows them to swing just about as hard as they can without creating unwanted tension in their upper half. The last important piece is to try to do this to the middle of the field so hitters don’t simply rotate around the ball and hook everything. I’ll tell hitters when they start to get too tight or when they are thinking too much to try to hit doubles and home runs to center field, but it has to come completely from your back hip. Once they feel how hard the baseball comes off with little to no effort up top, things get pretty fun. The challenge then becomes can you be the guy that drives baseball all over the yard, while everyone around you keeps saying “Wow look how easy he swings.”
Sequencing with the Pitcher
We discussed the timing checkpoints in the previous chapter, but what does this look and feel like as a hitter?
The key to sequencing your timing with the pitcher lies in the ability to control your backside. This means being able to move forward when you want to, rather than just falling from or bouncing off the load. To achieve this, we need to start loading into our backside earlier than most hitters think, hence the frequent advice to “start earlier.” Finding that moment to start loading really begins in the on-deck circle. If you are going to be off time, it’s better to miss on the side of being a little too early rather than too late, as it is always easier and more beneficial to slow things down than to speed them up.
As we discussed in the last chapter, a good time to start loading or getting to your back hip is when the pitcher’s hands break or even at the top of their leg lift. This should give you enough time to get to your backside in control, meaning you could essentially balance on the back leg if needed. (Again, this may not apply to all hitters, as some have wider stances, but in either case, you should feel strong tension in your back hip, groin, and/or glute.) We should be at our strongest point in the load and ready to move forward as the ball is being released or even slightly before. This is one of my favorite topics in the swing, and I like to refer to this spot as a “settle.” In this position, you are in your back hip with time to spare; you are not stopping and trying to restart, but rather you are able to continue to build or coil and allow your body to see the pitch out of the pitcher’s hand as best as possible. As the ball comes out, the backside now controls the movement forward into the stride. As you rotate with the back hip, the hands, being relaxed, explode through the zone, where we aim to make contact out front.
This “settle” area is very important. Again, we don’t want to be sitting in a stopped position at the top of our load, but the ability to “settle” at the top while keeping tension in our backside and waiting to attack is something that is difficult to articulate. From a pitcher’s perspective, or when throwing batting practice, this point can be best understood. Let me explain: when I throw BP to a player, I can typically tell if they are going to hit the ball well just before I release the pitch. Most hitters, especially younger ones, tend to start their load too late, meaning that as I am about to release the pitch, they begin loading, which greatly reduces their chances of hitting the ball hard. Can they still do it occasionally? Of course, but the odds of doing it consistently drop dramatically.
On the other end of the spectrum, a player who loads too early but doesn’t settle may end up falling forward or striding early and stopping before I release the pitch, which can diminish their opportunity to hit from this weaker position. Then there are players who start loading as my hands separate or even earlier, calmly getting to their back hip where I can see them settle or catch their weight. They appear calm, cool, and collected without stopping. Their backside is just waiting to move forward into the pitch. With this hitter, just before release, sometimes as my arm goes back, there is a sense that if I throw this pitch in the zone, the chances of them doing a lot of damage are very high. Pitchers can see and feel this as well. This is because they are on time and have the control not only to be on time with the pitch but also to make adjustments if needed. Even if they start moving a little early, as long as their backside is in control, they have enough energy left in their back hip to ride it out a little longer in order to still do some damage. The same goes if they are just a little late; their backside can speed them up just enough to catch up without tensing up the rest of their body. They are giving themselves a much larger window to hit in, which increases their chances of making solid contact.
This is the player who, as they drive forward into their stride, rides their back hip, meaning their back shoulder or head stays over their back hip as they move forward into the pitch. This feeling of “staying behind” the baseball creates a much greater margin for error compared to the hitter who falls forward, gets stuck on the back hip, or bounces off the load. I have heard stories from big league pitchers about facing hitters who are fully loaded and ready to go as the arm comes around. When they see this, they start worrying about missing their spot because they know that if they miss, it could be trouble. Again, hitting a baseball is incredibly difficult; we are just looking to give ourselves the biggest possible window to find the barrel. Once you understand how to get back early with control, it can reach a point where you feel like you are waiting on the fastball rather than reacting to it. That is an ideal spot to be in as a hitter.
Simplifying the Thought Process - No More Overthinking Your Mechanics
One of the biggest benefits of this timing, beyond smoother mechanics and increased power, is that it has the potential to simplify your thought process at the plate. Once you practice this enough and focus on the timing piece—starting with your tempo off the tee, getting on time in front toss and batting practice, and then in live at-bats—you will develop a “feel” for good timing. You will reach a point where, during batting practice, you can shut your swing down because your body knows you are too late to starting your load, and it doesn’t want to speed up to reach a pitch you already know you are late for.
As this knowledge and feel grow with repetition, your thought process at the plate becomes simpler. I know that when I struggled at the plate, I immediately focused on my mechanics and what I was doing wrong. So, during the next at-bat or game, I brought those mechanical thoughts to the plate: “My hands should be here,” “I should sit deeper in my legs,” “Keep your shoulder closed.” As you can guess, this typically made the struggle worse, as my swing became slower and more rigid with all those mechanical thoughts. Once you understand that the majority of your “mechanical issues” actually stem from your timing being off—most often being late or lacking control—you don’t have to over-complicate your thoughts at the plate. If you miss a pitch or roll over, the question becomes: Was I on time? If not, then for the next pitch or at-bat, you get back a little earlier and go after it again. When hitters are consistently on time, their swings become more free and aggressive, unencumbered by too many thoughts.
Toward the end of my career, as I began to figure out timing, my thought process shrank to simply getting on time with my load. From there, it was just about hunting the pitch I was looking for. For more advanced hitters, they don’t even need to think about the timing of the load, as it becomes so ingrained that it transforms into a simple aggressive thought—or sometimes no thought at all—if they are really in the zone.
Most of us have experienced that feeling of being "in the zone," where other players might ask you what pitch you just crushed, and sometimes you can’t even remember what it was; you just knew you hammered it. Anyone who has been in the zone knows this feeling and how fleeting it can be. I am not promising that you will find the zone with this approach to better timing, but I would argue that the more consistently you can be on time and maintain control in your back hip, the less thinking there will be, which will allow you to get into the zone more often. This comes with a lot of practice, though, and is not something you will experience without hundreds of hours of dedicated effort. We will discuss more about finding the zone in a later chapter.
In summary, mastering the load and timing in your swing is crucial for becoming a successful hitter. By focusing on the load, maintaining control in your back hip, and simplifying your thought process, you can enhance your performance at the plate. Remember, the goal is to create a strong foundation that allows you to react effectively to pitches, making adjustments as necessary while keeping your upper body relaxed. With practice and awareness, you can develop the timing and control needed to maximize your potential as a hitter.
Chapter 5 - Other Situations
There are several situations where the process of getting into the backside and staying on time can be more challenging. The first one is hitting off a machine. When we hit off a tee, we can create our own tempo, and with front toss and batting practice, we have an arm to go off of. However, a machine, unless it's a high-end model like a pro batter, can be more difficult because there's no arm to go off of. This can cause issues for hitters, especially if the load and timing concept is new. Nevertheless, I believe machines can be great for proving to hitters that they can always hit when they're early and have control. As soon as they're late, the machine will quickly expose their flaws.
First, we need to understand that the distance at which the machine is placed makes a huge difference. When the machine is at 55 feet, or about where a pitcher would release the ball, the timing becomes very similar. We want to be at the top of our load when the ball is leaving the machine, although velocity and pitch type may vary this slightly. When the machine is at 35 feet, things get much more challenging, especially at higher velocities.
So, how do we combat this? If the machine is close, think about what we discussed earlier regarding when the foot gets down in relation to the pitch. It's typically about halfway to two-thirds of the way to the plate, or around 32.5 feet (half of 55 feet at release is 32.5 feet). With a machine at 35 feet, it's basically already halfway there. If the ball leaves the machine, especially at a higher velocity, and the hitter is still getting loaded, they have almost zero chance of making good contact. Machines spin the ball faster, so the pitch will tend to hold velocity longer than someone who is pitching, making it even faster in the hitter's eyes.
This is the challenging part with a machine set at a short distance: we need to be almost getting into the ground as the ball is leaving the machine. However, as long as we have control in our backside, this shouldn't be too much of an issue. I've had hitters get loaded and get their front foot in the ground before the machine releases the ball, but they keep their weight in their backside. Once the machine releases the ball, they just need to think about firing their backside to the baseball and beating it to a spot out front. This is a great way to prove to hitters that even if they're down early, as long as they still have tension and control in their backside, they can hit.
As you get used to the load and timing, you'll be able to sync up with a machine at a shorter distance. For most hitters, it will be loading as the hand comes down and being done with the load as the ball comes down the ramp. From there, most hitters with good control will have an easier time figuring out the rest of the timing.
The curveball machine is one of my favorites for working on control in the backside. Keep the same timing we discussed off the fastball machine, but now that you know you're seeing a curveball, it will force you to "sit" in your backside longer. If you can ride your backside or stay behind the ball longer, you should have no problem with this pitch. I've seen many hitters have an "ah-ha" moment regarding controlling their backside when they hit off a curveball machine.
A situation that will present itself in a game is a pitcher who slide-steps. This was my nightmare, as I had a longer load. I wanted to see the pitcher come up with a big leg lift so I had a clear visual of when to start my load, but a slide-step style pitcher always had me feeling rushed and anxious about when he would start his motion. Thankfully, the more control you gain with your load, the easier this situation gets.
There are two ways to combat a slide-step pitcher. The first is what we'll call anticipation. If you look back at Robinson Cano's videos, he was a master at this. When the pitcher comes set, you can slowly start to build your load in anticipation that he will start his motion. If you can calmly build into your backside and do so while keeping your front foot on the ground, you should have enough time to move through the rest of your load as you see him start his motion. The idea is to get to where you're not stopped, but you're slowly building up your backside, and it feels like you're just waiting to see the hands separate. From here, it's a normal swing, as the backside takes you to the baseball.
The other way to do this is to preset your load. It's similar to the example above, but instead of setting up in your normal stance, you would set up with a preset load, or already have a 70-30 weight distribution on your backside. So now the load becomes much shorter, as a large majority of it is already taken care of. Now you're just waiting to see those hands separate. This can cause a feeling of being a bit stuck sometimes, but some hitters prefer it so they don't feel like they're guessing with the anticipation setup. Some hitters use a combination of the two.
On the flip side, there are now pitchers like Johnny Cueto and Nestor Cortez who will try to throw off your rhythm by almost pausing in their windup or rocking back and forth at the top of their leg lift. Again, a patient hitter who has control in their backside is simply waiting to see those hands separate. The one thing these types of pitchers cannot do is manipulate their motion once the hands separate. The tricky part is when these types of pitchers also incorporate a slide step or quick pitch. It may be worth using the anticipation or preset move against pitchers that you know tend to do this in order to cut down any extra time in your load. The more calmly you can sit in that hip and wait for the hands, the more success you will have. These pitchers are looking for any way they can throw off your timing, but the more control you have, the harder you will make it on them.
I always liked watching Gary Sanchez when he was swinging the bat well. Sanchez has quite a long, high leg kick. It's a pretty long, drawn-out load, so I was always shocked that he could hit off guys who slide-stepped. I decided to break down some of his video, and what I found not only blew me away but also confirmed how much control he had in his backside. Off a regular-style pitcher, Sanchez would load early and have no problem with his high leg kick, but when he faced a slide-step, something impressive happened. He would start his load as normal or a little anticipated, but his leg kick would disappear, and it would turn into more of a regular stride. What happens is that Sanchez has so much control in his backside that there's no thought in his front foot. When he loads with a standard pitcher, he naturally comes up into a high leg kick and can even hang out a bit if he needs more time, because of the control in his backside. Then, when facing a slide-step, his backside still takes him to the baseball, but his body knows it doesn't have time to get to the high leg kick and hang out; the backside just takes him straight to the baseball. If this were reversed, and the front foot was trying to time everything up, there's no way he could make that adjustment. The foot would be slamming down too early or rushing to get down after a slide-step, and there would be no consistency. Having backside control and not thinking about his front foot is the only way this adjustment is possible. To be honest, he may not even have known that it happened on any particular swing. That's how much control and trust there is.
The last situation I want to discuss is facing pitchers who throw under hitting speed (the "junkballers" and the slow pitchers that all teams complain about). These guys are tough to hit because we have more time to think about what's happening during the pitch. Plus, we tend to put too much pressure on ourselves because players and coaches think it should be easier to hit a guy like this. I definitely understand why I had a harder time with these types of pitchers as a younger hitter; it was because I had no control in my backside. With a slower pitcher, I tried to start later or ended up lunging to my front side because I had no ability to sit into my back hip and ride it. This is the key to these slower pitchers: you can still start your load as normal, but we have to hold our backside longer. Most hitters go through the same load, but because they have no backside control, they bounce off their load and end up lunging or falling to their front foot, where they get weak contact or swing and misses. If we can be patient enough to hold our backside longer, hitting against this type of pitcher will become a lot more enjoyable, as you'll have a lot more time to see the pitch without being put into a weak position to hit. It can still be an uncomfortable at-bat, but staying in your backside longer should make it easier to combat this style of pitching. I'm sure you've heard coaches tell you to think the other way off these pitchers, which is very true and is essentially their way of telling you to stay back in your backside. But now that you have a better understanding of how to control your backside, this should be an easier thing to accomplish.
Chapter 6 – Potential Issues

Just like any mechanic you are working on, issues can arise as you try to get into your backside earlier. This new timing may give you the sensation of being too early, causing your body to want to lunge forward to stay in line with your old tempo. The first time I attempted to get back earlier, I did so, but my tempo remained the same. As a result, I got back early, which led to my foot coming down way too soon and stopping my momentum. What we want to achieve is getting back early while truly feeling the control and balance in our backside. There should be no rush to move forward if we do this correctly.
On the flip side, it is possible to get stuck on the back hip. This usually results in an awkward turn, leading to snap-hooking the ball or being extremely late. Getting stuck can happen when we lean too far over our backside and/or lose control. It can also occur if we get back too late, causing the ball to reach us before we have a chance to move forward into the stride.
Another issue that may arise is getting into your load on time but still being late to contact. How can this happen?
This situation occurred during my first Spring Training. After signing the year before, I developed a better sense of timing and worked all offseason on building up my load as much as possible, ensuring it was early enough. I felt great as I traveled to Spring Training the following year. However, once I started facing live pitchers, I was still consistently late. To combat this, I moved even earlier, yet I still couldn’t catch up to a fastball. After struggling for some time, a coach pulled me aside and informed me that my load was fine and that I was giving myself plenty of time, but I was not committing to moving forward. Essentially, I was loading and sitting on my backside until I saw the pitch, then trying to get everything going. This can happen when we overthink or strive for perfection. I was so focused on ensuring everything was perfect in my timing and identifying the pitch that I wasn’t trusting that being on time would allow me to see the pitch better. I didn’t trust the control I had spent all offseason building.
Fortunately, this issue isn’t difficult to resolve. A simple way to approach it is to set your sights on where you want to make contact. For me, I aimed to make contact just in front of the plate or slightly beyond where my stride foot landed. However, since I was late, my contact point was actually in the middle of my body (in relation to the pitch's depth), which is why my contact was weak or nonexistent. To address this, I started pushing my sights further out in front. For example, if I was trying to make contact five inches in front of the plate but was catching the ball in the middle of the plate, I needed to set my sights a foot out in front of the plate to catch it at the five-inch marker I initially wanted. This forced me to commit to the forward motion earlier, giving my body the time it needed to make contact where I wanted. This is a classic example of tricking your brain, which we often do in baseball. It’s similar to when you roll over three pitches in a row; your thought should be, “Okay, I’m going to hit one the other way,” and you usually end up hitting it in the middle.
If you have been in this game long enough, you know that every day your body and swing can feel a little different. What worked yesterday may feel awful today, and vice versa. I dealt with this frustrating reality throughout my career, and my instinct was to try to change my mechanics. However, this often led to more thinking, which hindered my swing further. Don’t get me wrong; improving mechanics is a crucial part of the game, and tinkering is the only way to discover what works best. What I’m saying is that even with the same mechanics and thoughts, each day will feel slightly different. What is often overlooked is how your timing and tempo vary from day to day. This should be the first question we ask ourselves when things start to feel off. We need to ensure our tempo is calm, that we are in control, and that our timing is right. This will resolve many issues, as it is very easy to “feel good” and jump into a cage with an elevated heart rate, completely forgetting about your tempo. This can lead to rushing and mechanical breakdowns.
There will also be days when the tempo and timing seem right, but you are still off. This is when we need to learn to enjoy the struggle and the process. The swing is a complex thing, and even professionals feel different from day to day. During these times, we must evaluate and exaggerate, as in the previous example. When you are rolling over pitches, try to hit a few hard ground balls; if you feel like you are standing up, exaggerate the feeling in your legs. The more you swing and the more aware you are of the feel of your swing, the easier these day-to-day adjustments will become, and the more enjoyable the process will be. Most of the time, we do not need to make significant mechanical adjustments to our swing; it is usually just these simple thoughts and exaggerations that we need to work through.
In summary, being aware of your timing and tempo is crucial for maintaining a consistent swing. Embrace the fluctuations in how your body feels from day to day, and remember that it’s normal to experience ups and downs. By focusing on your timing, controlling your backside, and adjusting your mental approach, you can navigate the challenges of hitting more effectively. Trust in the work you’ve put in, and allow yourself the freedom to make small adjustments rather than overhauling your mechanics. This mindset will help you stay relaxed and confident at the plate, ultimately leading to better performance and enjoyment of the game.

Chapter 8 - Final Thoughts

The art of hitting a baseball is one of the most challenging things to do consistently in all of sports. It requires a great deal of physical ability, but as anyone who has done it for a long time will tell you, the mental side is the true separator. For big league hitters, the pressure to perform and the chess match going on between hitter and pitcher are just a few examples of the mental challenges they face. For younger hitters who don't get to play every day under the lights every night, the challenges still remain, but can be different.
A big challenge for any hitter is to take all the thinking you do in the cage and then not think about any of it once you get to the game. Every hitter goes through the struggle of overthinking in the box, especially when it comes to mechanics. The ability to trust the work you put in and to allow yourself to just play without overthinking is something most of us actually need to practice. This takes a lot of awareness and experimentation on what helps clear your mind or to keep the thoughts very simple.
What helped me simplify my thoughts in the game was actually understanding my timing. Because I worked so hard on my swing, I started asking myself how I could get my swing to feel so good in the cage only to have it fail me at the plate. Why would my mechanics break down in a game and not in the cage? Once I realized that being late, even just slightly, caused my body to cheat the mechanics, the thoughts about mechanics started to go away. Instead of trying to fix my hands or stance in the box after missing a pitch, I tried to think back to the earliest part of my swing, the load, and ask myself, did I get started early enough? The majority of the time the answer was no, and it became obvious when I swung and missed, or fouled a ball off, that I was late. Once I knew that, I didn't have to worry about mechanics anymore; I simply started my load earlier, giving myself more time to see the pitch and let it fly from there.
As a hitter, if you train yourself to look back in your swing to the earliest point, you can start to think more critically about what could have caused you to miss your pitch. Instead of simply getting frustrated and telling yourself that you suck, or that you should keep your hands higher, go back through the feeling of that swing and ask yourself if you were on time. If no, then you can start earlier. Or maybe the load seemed on time, but you felt stuck, so the thought becomes "go get the baseball out front." Did you feel any tension in your hands or shoulders? Maybe you tried to do too much or you ended up rushing. Having the ability to quickly think through your last swing and the feeling you had throughout it allows the thought process to become much clearer, and in return, the problems become easier to diagnose, because we can think through the process rationally.
A pretty common conversation that comes up when I work with hitters goes something like this:
Hitter: (Frustrated) Uh, I rolled over again. Me: Why did you roll over? Hitter: I don’t know, I think I pulled my shoulder. Me: Why did you pull your shoulder? Hitter: (More frustration) I just do that on inside pitches. I feel like the pitch was going to beat me on the inner half. Me: Did it feel like the ball was getting in on you or going to beat you? Hitter: Yeah. Me: Why did it feel like it was going to beat you? Hitter: Well, I felt late. Me: Why did you feel late? Hitter: I didn’t start my load early enough. Me: Bingo. Simple fix, let’s try to get back a little calmer and a little earlier and see if you can get to that same pitch.
Typically, the result is a good swing on the next pitch, and there is some relief for the hitter. No mechanics were changed, just the understanding that we need to create more time for our body to do what we trained it to do. The thought process becomes much simpler and freeing because we are not guessing about what changes we need to make pitch to pitch.
In these conversations, we are trying to diagnose the root cause of the issue or, in this case, the roll over. The more you can ask yourself why, or work back through the swing to the earliest point (the load), the more you will start to understand how timing plays a huge role in the result of your swing. This can be difficult, especially when there is some frustration going on, but as you get used to it, the adjustments and the thought process become much easier.
With enough time and awareness, this process will become a feel. Your body will know when it is late, you may even shut a swing down before the pitch is released because your body felt that it didn’t start on time and it won’t be able to catch up efficiently.
As you spend more time mastering this and the thought process gets simpler, you may find that you get into what athletes call the zone more often.
Finding the zone takes hundreds of hours of awareness and practice. Finding the zone in a brand new endeavor is next to impossible because you are having to think about every step throughout the process. You have new feelings and thoughts in the body that you are unfamiliar with, and you have to go through the process of figuring out what works and what doesn’t. The zone comes from completely surrendering or trusting that your body will do the movements you have trained it to do. This only happens after thousands of repetitions.
I think a good example in today’s world is video games. People get into the zone all the time in video games, because well, they spend a lot of time playing them, so the movements become natural and they are a lot less complex to learn, as far as the body mechanics go (it is easier to pick up a controller and learn a video game than it is to learn to swing a bat efficiently). The ability to get into the zone in a high-stakes moment in a video game happens much faster than something as complex as hitting. The zone can be found in any endeavor, whether it is baseball, archery, video games, art, music, or coding, but getting there remains the same. It is a hyper-focus, but with no tension, like meditation, but in action. You trust your body so much in the action that you do not have to think about anything but the end goal, and you may not even think of that. You surrender to the moment and what happens is pure joy and ease as you perform the action.
Staying Positive
The deeper you dive into a skill, and the more time you put into it, the more you will encounter small variations and feel little things in your mechanics that don’t feel right. This can lead to frustration and overthinking, which can make it hard to stay positive. However, a perspective that may help a hitter who faces these challenges after putting a lot of time in is knowing that most players won’t even get to this point because they won’t have put in enough work to go through the ups and downs and the thought process along with it. It is because you have worked so hard that you even have these situations. I know that sounds a little strange, but for hitters that haven’t put in a lot of work, they don’t get to the advanced level of figuring out the minute details of the swing. They can’t feel it enough, so these thoughts don’t even come up.
For the hitter that has spent hundreds or thousands of hours in the cage, you will experience feelings and very minute details that can seem to make or break your swing from day to day, when in reality the average hitter may not know what you are even talking about. Knowing that this struggle is almost a right of passage is a good perspective because it proves you have put in so much more work. This higher level of knowledge of your swing will typically get you out of the inevitable slumps faster than hitters who can’t feel their swing as much.
We have to find ways to stay positive, whether that be in progress, challenges, or small wins (for example, earning a walk, a sac fly, a hard out, etc.) and focus on them. Instead of watching video for mistakes you are making, focus on what looks good. If you go 0-3 but hit three line drives, you should be excited about that (easier said than done). If you struggle at the plate, maybe you made a couple of great plays in the field or took an extra base in a big situation. We have to find ways to keep ourselves positive and excited about this game full of failure. No other game is quite like it, and it will challenge you mentally in ways other sports cannot.
One of the best things I was told when playing pro ball, that helped my confidence and my ability to stay positive, was to “Keep your strengths, your strengths and work on your weaknesses.” Sometimes we get so focused on our weaknesses and improving them that we can get defeated when focusing on the weakness so much. This coach made it clear that it is essential to work on weaknesses, but it is a weakness for a reason, and we shouldn’t get so stuck on our weaknesses that we lose our strengths or what we are best at.
My personal example was the up and away pitch. I struggled to get on top of that pitch and do anything with it other than flair it off, but I was really good with anything middle in as a left-handed hitter. The advice was that I probably wouldn’t ever be able to hit a high and away pitch out of the yard consistently, but I should be able to drive that pitch for a single or double. That said, I shouldn’t allow all the work I put into that up and away pitch to detract from the middle-in pitch that I handle really well. Make sure to work on both in order to hit that up and away pitch when needed, but don’t focus on the weakness so much that you lose the ability to drive your favorite pitch. This concept reinforced my confidence in my ability to hit my favorite pitch and encouraged me to continue working on a pitch I didn’t like. I gained more confidence and didn’t stress as much, whereas in the past I had coaches tell me, "Keep working on the up and away pitch because you don’t hit it well." My entire focus was on a pitch I hated, which I did need to work on, but I was so stressed about it that I didn’t think of anything else. My confidence was down, and I started missing my favorite pitch because I was so geared up for something up and away at all times.
This thought process leads into knowing who you are as a hitter, which is one of the most important things you need to understand. Not all great hitters have to hit thirty home runs a year. Trying to be that guy when your size doesn't fit that role is not going to be beneficial for you or your team. If you have the ability to make a ton of contact, you are a difficult out and have a lot of speed, embrace that skill set and continue to make it your strength. Be the guy that starts rallies and takes extra bases so the home run guy behind you can drive you in. It can be a hard and humbling lesson to imagine that you are the power hitter in the lineup and then have to face the reality later down the road that you may not be. That doesn’t mean you aren’t better at other aspects of hitting than the home run guy.
Derek Jeter and Aaron Judge are vastly different hitters, and yet they have both been captain of the Yankees, and Judge will most likely join Jeter in the Hall of Fame. The one thing that makes all great hitters similar is that they can square up a baseball; the results of that ability are just different from hitter to hitter.
Call to Action
While I hope this information helps any hitters who end up applying it, the truth of the matter is that there is no one piece of information that will make you a great hitter. Just because you know how to get on time, doesn’t mean you can do it every time. Hitting is one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult things to do in sports. To truly be great at this complex skill of hitting, you have to apply yourself… a lot. The difference between a great hitter and an okay hitter, even if they get the same information, is that the great hitter practices more often and typically thinks about hitting more often. Being on time is one major aspect of hitting, but we still need to train our other mechanics, our approach, our mental game, and get physically stronger. This is no easy task, and the truly great hitters spend thousands of hours working on their craft.
A concept that has been around for a long time, but has been lost to much of society, is the idea of lowering your time preference. The lower your time preference is, the farther into the future you tend to look. This allows you to plan and make goals on a longer time horizon. The higher your time preference, the more you think about the immediate or short-term future, next year, next month, or even today. Most of the things we interact with in our world are working to shorten our time preference or attention span. For example, Google used to be fast, now we have AI to find instant answers. Diet pills and supplements are people’s preferred method of losing weight instead of taking the time to go to the gym and eating better. Video games used to make you work for better weapons and armor, now you buy them, and we scroll endlessly through social media from one meaningless video to the next for something to grab our attention for a brief time and then it’s on to the next rush. Studies show attention span is only 8.25 seconds now.
In order to be really good at something, especially hitting, you need to lower your time preference, you need to be patient and enjoy the work. The ability to master a skill or really get in tune with your swing takes a lot of repetitions and a long time, day in and day out. This is why most people do not get to the higher levels. It takes a lot of time and effort, and we prefer things to be instant. Step back, think about lowering your time preference, and how the work you put in day after day will compound to make you a great hitter, not just tomorrow or next year, but three, five, or even ten years down the road. Enjoy the process and the challenge of improving your skills, even when it is in small ways.
You have to learn to love the process, but to be fair, you do not need to enjoy every step of the process in order to enjoy chasing your goals and enjoying success. I can confidently say I hated any type of cardio workouts, but because I knew that was going to get me better, it was easier to get through those workouts and get to more things I enjoyed, because ultimately I enjoyed the success I knew it was going to bring me. I enjoyed becoming the top hitter on my team or reaching my next goal more than I hated sprints, so I kept doing them. There will be many ups and downs, but the more you apply yourself, the faster you will adjust, and the more people you will surpass. There is no secret formula, just more hard work.
I will leave you with a simplified process of achieving mastery in anything you do that I picked up in the book - The Bushido of Bitcoin. I added the italicized part to relate the concepts to the swing as discussed in this book.
Achieving Mastery
Step 1: You begin with unconscious incompetence (you don’t know what you don’t know)
You are given a new concept of timing and you apply it in the cage to the best of your ability. However, because it is new, you don’t have a grasp of the feel, the sequencing or what future issues may arise. You are simply trying something new.
Step 2: You develop conscious incompetence (awareness of your shortcomings)
You stick with it as it starts to help your swing and make more sense. You notice that many successful hitters are applying the same concept. As you practice more, you begin to understand the cues that help you succeed and the parts that you still struggle with.
Step 3: You move into conscious competence (you can, but must concentrate to execute)
You continue to practice, research and think about your timing and how to make it consistent. You know how to do it in games and you have success, but it still takes a lot of thinking to be consistent at it. As your mind drifts away from the thought of timing or your mental cues, you become late or rushed again.
Step 4: You reach unconscious competence (you don’t think you just do.) In other words, it’s in your body, and you’ve achieved mastery
The timing is so ingrained it becomes a feel. Your body knows when to start, how to control the backside and when to fire. You may even shut your swing down, because your body had the awareness to know that you were late and then you naturally make the adjustment to get on time with the next pitch. You are free of any complex thoughts and can put your focus completely into seeing the pitch or on your approach. This is where players get the feeling of entering the “zone”. The ball seems to slow down and things feel effortless.
This is not always linear process and there will be times when you feel like you are going backwards, but even times of frustration can be used to reflect and grow. The struggle is a necessary part of mastering a skill, so embrace it and know that you are on the right track.
